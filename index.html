            Hogwarts was founded around the 10th century by four of the greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.  
            Each founing member represented a personality trait they they wished to bring out in new students. Gryffindor students would embody bravery and chivalry, Ravenclaw students are known to be smart and full of wit, 
            Hufflepuff the loyalist of them all and Slytherin who values cunning.
