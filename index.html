        <div class="about-content">
        <p class="about-section-p">Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a British wizarding boarding school located in the Scottish Highlands and is considered one of the finest magical 
            institutions in the wizarding world. We are a state-owned school and receives our funding from the Ministry of Magic. We accept children aged pupils aged eleven to seventeen who live in Britain or Ireland.
            <br>
            Hogwarts was founded around the 10th century by four of the greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.  
            Each founing member represented a personality trait they they wished to bring out in new students. Gryffindor students would embody bravery and chivalry, Ravenclaw students are known to be smart and full of wit, 
            Hufflepuff the loyalist of them all and Slytherin who values cunning.

                  Once students enter their third year they will get the opportunity to visit the village on the weekends so they can stock up on supplies and socialize. 
                  <br>
                  Hogsmede is home to an array of small shops and boutiques such as Zonkos Joke shop which was founded in the 1980s and sells a range of joke and trick items. 
                  Honeydukes which was established in 1641 and sells a wide selection of sweet treats from Cauldron Cakes to Ice Mice

            <h2 class="houses-section-title section-title">Hogwarts Houses</h2>
              <p>The Witches and Wizards who founded Hogwarts all had different views on who should be taught and what qualities they possess, this disagreement resulted in the 
                dividing the school up into four houses and only allowing pupils they see fit into their house. 
                <br>
                This process is now called the sorting ceremony, on their first day students will be sorted into a house where they will stay for the remainder of their time at
                Hogwarts. 
                They will form a family with their house members and as a group compete to earn pints by exceling in lessons, winning quidditch and generally being helpful. 
                On the other hand, students will lose points for any rule breaking. 
                <br>
                At the end of the year, the points are tallied up and the house with the post points wins the house cup.
