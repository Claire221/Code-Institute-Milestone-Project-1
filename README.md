### Colours 
Throughout the website I want the theme to be dark with a pop of bright colours.

For the homepage I used a black background with an accent colour of dark maroon for the section paragraph backgrounds to make them stand out. After I added the colours I thought it looked a bit flat so I decided to slightly darked then background color as you went down the page to make it more visualy interesting. The first paragraph background was a light maroon color, the second one a mid tone and finally the last one a dark maroon colour. 

For the other pages I wanted to uses pops of color in the section that matched the images corelating to them, for the Hogwarts Houses page I used the staple colour of each Hogwarts house as the background. 

For the Lessons page I tried to pick out a colour that was in the background of each image and use that so both the image and the paragraph looked like they belonged together.

For the Staff members page I wanted to keep it fairly simple as not to draw attention away from the portraits or make the page to chaotic so I went with a simple white border around each profile card and a white background to the staff member description paragraph.

### Common Features
Throughout the website I wanted to keep certain elements the same so that the site has a coheisve feel and feels like its a part of the same narative. Each page has a header section with a background image corelating to what the section is about. 

The navigation menu is also exactly the same throughout the website so that its easilty navigatable by users. 

For the Hogwars Houses page and also the Lesson Page I kept the layouts the same card style with an image relating to the topic and a paragraph describing it.

## Individual Page Designs
### Home page
#### Header Section
For the header of the home page I wanted something that would catch someones attention as its the first thing they will see, I decided to do a hero image of Hogwarts Castle and I added a slight zoom effect to it. I also added two headings which welcome you to the page.

#### Cards
For the information on the home page I decided to go with a card format. Each card had a paragrpah that gave a small description of the topic and then a picture which corelated with the information in the paragraph. I decided to give each paragraph background a colour so that it stood out against the black page background and was easier to read. 
For the images I decided to go with an art style rather than a realistic photograph, I chose this design because I found that they were a lot more colourful so stood out on the page more, I also thought it gave the page a nice feel.

#### HR
Between each card I decided to add a Hr to break up the sections a bit. When I first created the cards I thought they were a bit bunched together so I started by adding a margin between them, I then felt that this made the page look a bit empty as there were big empty gaps between each section so I decided to go in with a HR. I didnt want the HR to be plain and boring because I didnt think that would fit in with the magical theme of the website so I decided to do something a bit different by creating a diamond shape in the middle.
