### Colours 
Throughout the website I want the theme to be dark with a pop of bright colours.

For the homepage I used a black background with an accent colour of dark maroon for the section paragraph backgrounds to make them stand out. After I added the colours I thought it looked a bit flat so I decided to slightly darked then background color as you went down the page to make it more visualy interesting. The first paragraph background was a light maroon color, the second one a mid tone and finally the last one a dark maroon colour. 

For the other pages I wanted to uses pops of color in the section that matched the images corelating to them, for the Hogwarts Houses page I used the staple colour of each Hogwarts house as the background. 

For the Lessons page I tried to pick out a colour that was in the background of each image and use that so both the image and the paragraph looked like they belonged together.

For the Staff members page I wanted to keep it fairly simple as not to draw attention away from the portraits or make the page to chaotic so I went with a simple white border around each profile card and a white background to the staff member description paragraph.

### Common Features
Throughout the website I wanted to keep certain elements the same so that the site has a coheisve feel and feels like its a part of the same narative. Each page has a header section with a background image corelating to what the section is about. 

The navigation menu is also exactly the same throughout the website so that its easilty navigatable by users. 

For the Hogwars Houses page and also the Lesson Page I kept the layouts the same card style with an image relating to the topic and a paragraph describing it.
