### Site Overview
The aim of the website is to be an informative site where parents would visit to see what the school is about and to see if they would like their children to enroll in it. The website will feature information about the school, staff and lessons taught there.

### Colours 
Throughout the website I want the theme to be dark with a pop of bright colours.

For the homepage I used a black background with an accent colour of dark maroon for the section paragraph backgrounds to make them stand out. After I added the colours I thought it looked a bit flat so I decided to slightly darked then background color as you went down the page to make it more visualy interesting. The first paragraph background was a light maroon color, the second one a mid tone and finally the last one a dark maroon colour. 

For the other pages I wanted to uses pops of color in the section that matched the images corelating to them, for the Hogwarts Houses page I used the staple colour of each Hogwarts house as the background. 

For the Lessons page I tried to pick out a colour that was in the background of each image and use that so both the image and the paragraph looked like they belonged together.

For the Staff members page I wanted to keep it fairly simple as not to draw attention away from the portraits or make the page to chaotic so I went with a simple white border around each profile card and a white background to the staff member description paragraph.

### Common Features
Throughout the website I wanted to keep certain elements the same so that the site has a coheisve feel and feels like its a part of the same narative. Each page has a header section with a background image corelating to what the section is about. 

The navigation menu is also exactly the same throughout the website so that its easilty navigatable by users. 

For the Hogwars Houses page and also the Lesson Page I kept the layouts the same card style with an image relating to the topic and a paragraph describing it.

## Individual Page Designs
### Home page
#### Header Section
For the header of the home page I wanted something that would catch someones attention as its the first thing they will see, I decided to do a hero image of Hogwarts Castle and I added a slight zoom effect to it. I also added two headings which welcome you to the page.

#### Cards
For the information on the home page I decided to go with a card format. Each card had a paragrpah that gave a small description of the topic and then a picture which corelated with the information in the paragraph. I decided to give each paragraph background a colour so that it stood out against the black page background and was easier to read. 
For the images I decided to go with an art style rather than a realistic photograph, I chose this design because I found that they were a lot more colourful so stood out on the page more, I also thought it gave the page a nice feel.

#### HR
Between each card I decided to add a Hr to break up the sections a bit. When I first created the cards I thought they were a bit bunched together so I started by adding a margin between them, I then felt that this made the page look a bit empty as there were big empty gaps between each section so I decided to go in with a HR. I didnt want the HR to be plain and boring because I didnt think that would fit in with the magical theme of the website so I decided to do something a bit different by creating a diamond shape in the middle.

### Hogwarts Houses page
For the Hogwarts house page I wanted to keep the style the same as the homepage so that they felt like a cohesive piece and part of the same website. The tricky part was find art that not only fit the style I was looking for but made sence with the inforamtion on the page. 

#### Header Section
For the header section on the Hogwarts Houses section I initially wanted to find a picture of the sorting ceremony but because I wanted a particular art style so I was limited with choices, I did however manage to find an artwork of the sorting hat in Dumbledores office and thought this went quite well. 

#### Cards
For the card section I kept the style and format the same as on the homepage, I had a paragraph giving a description of each house along with an image corelating to it. Initially I wanted to put images of the house crests however I was only able to find three out of the four crests in the art style I was going for and thought it looked disconjoined if I used a different image on the last house. For that reason I decided to go with images that reflected each houses common room, although it wasnt my initial idea I still think it turend out well as the common rooms are a big part of each house as they are where students spend a lot of time. Each common room is also decorated in a different style that fits the theme of each house so I thought it gives the viewer an idea of what the houses represent. I also coloured the paragraph sections with the main colour from each houses logo to tie it all together. 

#### HR
For the HR seperating the sections I initially had the same one as on the Home page, I then went back and changed it just to mix it up a bit and give a bit of visual difference. In the end I settles on a row of five stars each one slightly smaller than the next, I thought this design went well with the magical aspect of the site. 

### Classes page
Again with the classes page I kept it very similar to the pervious two pages as it was important to me that the pages as a whole felt like they are part of the same peice.  

#### Header Section
For the header section I managed to find an art work the represented a class setting so I decided to go with that. Becuause the image is brighter than the background I think it makes the heading section stand out. 

#### Cards
For the card section I kept the layout the same as the pervious pages. This time for the images I found artowrk that depicted each classroom to give a feel for what the classes might be like. I also coloured the paragraph section with a colour from the image, I chose a colour that wasnt as promenent so that it was a bit of a contrast. 

### Staff and Teachers page
For the staff and teachers page I mixed up the layout slightly, I still went with a cards design but I went with more of a galery or portfolio layout.

#### Header Section
For the header section I wanted a staff group photo, I wanted to give the feel that the staff had all got together to have a photo drawn or painted for it to be used on the school website. 

#### Cards
For the cards on the page I wanted to have their title, name and a breif description included. Also for the image I used real photos rather than artistic ones as I thought it made more sence to have genuine photos 

## Bugs
When I was testing my website I noticed that there was a problem with the bootstrap nav bar, when you went to smaller viewports it was collapsing but the hamburger menu wasnt working and when you clicked on it nothing happened. 

The first way I tried to fix it was to re put in the navbar template from bootstrap incase a change I had made had caused an issue, so I copied and pasted the code from bootstap and didnt change any of the classes or template text. I tried the different viewports again and the navbar hamburger menu still wanst working, this told me though that it wasnt an error with the HTML code.

Next I thought it might be an erorr with the CDN I had imported and this turned out to be correct, after trying a few recomended ones from Stack overflow and not having any luck I went back to the Bootstrap documentation and realised I had imported the wrong JavaScript file, I swapped out the one I already have with the new one and it fixed the issue.

## Deployment
I have deployed my website on Github Pages following the steps below: 
- Navigate to the projects github repository
- Once there go to the setting tab
- In the left hand page there should be a link called pages click that
- Next under branch you want to select main and under theme choose select a theme
- Finally click the save button and it should generate you a link for the website, this could take up to 20 minutes to become active.
