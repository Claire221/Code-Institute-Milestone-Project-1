        <h2 class="description-title">What Are Hogwarts Houses?</h2>
        <p class="description-section-p">When Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century, the founding members Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin all had different views on who 
          should and shouldnt be allowed to study at the school and also what traits and characteristics they should possess. This conflict resulted in them dividing the school into four houses, each with a founding
           member as the leader, each house could then accept the students that they thought were worthy of their house. 
           <br>
          So now on every students first day of school they will take part in the sorting ceremony where the sorting hat will be placed on their head and a house that best fits them picked. While at Hogwarts their 
          house will be like their family, they will live, eat and go to lessons with their fellow housemates. 
          <br>
          Throughout the year, they will compete to earn house points by winning sporting events, exceeding in lessons and for general good behaviour. If a student misbehaves, they face losing house points and at 
          the end of the school year, the house with the most house points gets the privilege of winning the house cup.

                  <p>Gryffindor house was founded by Godrick Gryffindor. Godrick was the Wizard who bewitched the sorting hat with each founding members requests so that it might pick the best student for each house.
                    <br> 
                    Godrick bewitched the sorting hat to choose students who possessed characteristics he valued above all else, courage, determination, chivalry and nerve. 
                    <br>
                    Godrick also had a sword made that was enchanted to appear to any worthy Griffindor in a time of need.

                  <p>Hufflepuff house was founded by  Helga Hufflepuff she thought that anyone should be able to study under house, all she asked was that they were hardworking, dedicated, loyal and patient. 
                    Hufflepuff house has a strong affinity to the element of earth and because of this; many of the students sorted into its house have exceptional abilities in Herbology. 
                    <br>
                    Helga Hufflepuff had a talent for food related charms and her recipes are still used for Hogwarts feasts to this day, she was also the one who arranged for the house elves to work in the kitchens
                     giving them somewhere safe to live and work.

                  <p>Rowena Ravenclaw founded Ravenclaw house and only students who possessed a keen wit, and an interest in learning or wisdom were sorted into it. 
                    <br>
                    Because of the needed traits to get into Ravenclaw the students granted access are very academically motivated and talented students, who pride themselves with being original in their ideas and 
                    methods.  
                    <br>
                    To this day Ravenclaw house is host to the Gray Lady or going by her real name Helena Ravenclaw who is the daughter of Rowena.

              <h2 class="slytherin-section-title section-title">Slytherin House</h2>
                <p>And last but not least there is Slytherin which was founded by Salazar Slytherin. He gave instructions to the sotring hats to have the traits he valued the most they had to be resourceful and 
                  cunning, have strong leadership skills and be highly ambitious. 
                  <br>
                  Because of the traits, Slythern requires it leads to many of the Slytherin students to band together and not always associate themselves with the other houses.

                  Salazar also gave the sorting hat one last requirement, that when choosing students for his house it favoured pureblooded students. Although Slytherin does not just admit pure bloods, 
                  it is very rare for the house to pick a muggle-born student.
